# 🐍 Python Practice Projects

Welcome to my Python practice folder! This repository contains a collection of small Python scripts, exercises, and mini-projects that I've written to improve my programming skills and explore different concepts in Python.

## 📌 What's Inside

This folder includes code for:

- ✅ Basic syntax and control flow
- 🔄 Loops and conditionals
- 🧮 Functions and recursion
- 📦 Modules and packages
- 🗃️ File I/O
- 🐛 Debugging and error handling
- 🧪 Unit testing
- 🧠 Data structures and algorithms
- 🌐 APIs and requests
- 🐼 Pandas / NumPy basics
- 🔧 Miscellaneous utility scripts

> This is a personal learning space — code may not be production-ready, but it's a reflection of progress!


## 💡 Goals

- Practice writing clean and efficient Python code
- Build a strong foundation for more advanced projects
- Explore different areas of programming

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Any additional dependencies will be mentioned in individual script headers or comments.

## 🧾 Notes

- Some files are standalone.
- Most scripts include comments or simple docstrings explaining the logic.
- If you're learning too, feel free to fork and use these for your own practice!

## 🚀 Getting Started
